**Brad Pasanek's model HW for Literary Games (2024)**

A few images were drawn from wikimedia and the internet. The sun and two planets are drawn directly on the Canvas as circles. I also added a Polygon2D node to put some space junk in orbit around my sun.

Finally, I used Path2D and PathFollow nodes to create an irregular orbit for my rocket ship sprite. 

I did not attempt the "Malenia" bonus, but it did get me reading about Physics in Godot.
